# Information Security | Third Year [TE SPPU]

This repository contains various programming projects related to information security. Here are some of the projects included:
ree
1. Write a Java/C/C++/Python program that contains a string (char pointer) with a value \Hello
Worldâ€™. The program should AND or and XOR each character in this string with 127 and
display the result.
2. Write a Java/C/C++/Python program to perform encryption and decryption using the method of
Transposition technique.
3. Write a Java/C/C++/Python program to implement DES algorithm.
4. Write a Java/C/C++/Python program to implement AES Algorithm.
5. Write a Java/C/C++/Python program to implement RSA algorithm.
6. Implement the different Hellman Key Exchange mechanism using HTML and JavaScript.
Consider the end user as one of the parties (Alice) and the JavaScript application as other party
(bob).
7. Calculate the message digest of a text using the MD5 algorithm in JAVA.
